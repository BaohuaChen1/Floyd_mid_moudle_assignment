# Floyd_Algorithm-2022
Floyd Algorithm for the mid-module assignment

Imperative and Recursive Versions Of Floyd_Warshall Algorithm
Project Description:

This is a recursive implementation of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm The program is designed to find the shortest path in a graph using recursion.

Testing Case:
Some examples of the testing cases are created, for the purpose of testing if the expecting results are equal to the specific output.

Performance test:
In order to compare the time elapsed between the two versions of algorithm, the performance tests are created.

To run the unit tests, use the unit_test.py file, To run the performance tests, use the performance_test.py file.
